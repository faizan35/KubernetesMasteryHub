# 2. Key Components of ReplicaSets:

### Pod Template or `template`:

- It contains the specifications that define how each pod should be created.
- Here are some key elements you might find in a pod template:
  - Container Images
  - Volumes
  - Pod Specifications

### Selector

- **Types of Selectors:-** `matchLabels`, `matchExpressions`
- It help to select Pods with matching lables(like tags).
- In this example, the ReplicaSet is looking for Pods with the label `app: my-app`.

  ```yaml
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  ```

- labels in the `selector` field match the labels used in the metadata section of the Pod template.

- **`matchExpressions`**: is used for for **complex lable selection** criteria.
- In this example, This selector, looks for Pods with the label environment set to either `production` or `staging`.

```yaml
selector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: environment
      operator: In
      values:
        - production
        - staging
```

### Replicas

- It represent the desired number of identical pods.
- This number, ReplicaSet, aims to maintain.

- **`template`**: defines the Pod template with a container running the `my-image:latest` image.
- **`selector`**: uses the label `app: my-app` to identify which Pods are part of this ReplicaSet.
- **`replicas`**: is set to `3`, indicating that the desired state is to have three replicas.
