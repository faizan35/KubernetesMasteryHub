# ReplicaSets

## What are they?

ReplicaSet is a resource or controller that **ensures** a specified number(**desired state**) of <u>replicas of a **pods** are running at all times</u>.

## How do ReplicaSets Work?

Lets Break it down:
: - You declare a manifest file of **`kind: ReplicaSet`**, with a certain number of **`replicas`** (**desired state**).
: - ReplicaSet controller <u>constantly monitors</u> the actual **state** of the pods.
: - If there are lesss replicas that desired state, it creates more.
: - If there are too many, it scales down.

This way, it helps ensure high availability and resilience in your application by automatically managing the number of running instances.

## Why do we need ReplicaSets?

Lets say you have a web app running with multiple Pods. If one of the Pod fails the app will be down this is why we need ReplicaSets. It automatically replace it to match with desired state, keeping web app always running.

## Some Imp Points

#### ReplicationControllers vs. ReplicaSets

- ReplicationControllers is the **older version** of ReplicaSets.
- ReplicaSets offers set-based selector criteria and label selectors so its better.

#### ReplicaSets vs. Deployments:

- **ReplicaSets**: Focus on maintaining a set number of identical Pods.
- **Deployments**: Abstraction layer above ReplicaSets, providing declarative updates, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

#### When to Use ReplicaSets:

- Suitable for basic scaling and fault tolerance needs.
- When you require a specific number of identical Pods running.

#### When to Use Deployments:

- For advanced deployment strategies like rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases.
- When you need better rollback capabilities and revision history.
