# Multi-container Pods - [Link](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/multi-container-pods-and-container-communication-in-kubernetes/)

Pods can host multiple containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes.
Useful for scenarios where containers need to work together or share resources within the same Pod.

### Init Containers:

Init containers run before the main container starts, assisting in preparing the environment.
They provide a way to ensure that certain conditions are met before the primary application container starts.
Pod Lifecycle Phases

### Pods go through various phases:

- **Pending**: The Pod is accepted by the system, and resources are being allocated.
- **Running**: All containers in the Pod are running, and at least one is in the running phase.
- **Succeeded**: All containers in the Pod have terminated successfully.
- **Failed**: All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has failed.
- **Unknown**: The state of the Pod cannot be determined.
