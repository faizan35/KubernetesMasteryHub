# 2.2 Pod Lifecycle Management

## Initialization, Running, and Termination Phases

### Initialization Phase:

During the initialization phase, Pods can execute one or more init containers before the main container starts.
Init containers are useful for tasks like pre-populating data, setting up configurations, or waiting for external services.

### Running Phase:

The main container runs during this phase, executing the application or service that the Pod is designed for.
The Pod remains in the running phase until the main container terminates or encounters an issue.

### Termination Phase:

In the termination phase, the Pod is gracefully shut down.
The containers receive termination signals, giving them an opportunity to clean up resources before exiting.

## Probes and Health Checks

### Probes:

- Kubernetes uses probes to check the health of containers within a Pod.
- Three types of probes:
  - Liveness Probe: Determines if the container is running successfully. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
  - Readiness Probe: Checks if the container is ready to accept traffic. Used for load balancing and service availability.
  - Startup Probe: Used to delay the liveness and readiness probes during the initial startup, allowing additional time for initialization.
