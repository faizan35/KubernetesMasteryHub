# Create your first Pod

Step 1:- Create the Manifest file
: - Write the "desired state", and save the YAML manifest file, on **control-plane**. let's say `example-pod.yaml`.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  labels:
    app: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container-1
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  restartPolicy: Always
```

Step 2:- Apply the Manifest
: - Navigate to the dir where the YAML file is saved and run the following command:

For first time.

```bash
kubectl create -f <name_of_the_file>.yaml
```

Updating the pod.

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yaml
```

Step 3:- Check Pod Status.
: - Wait until the Pod's STATUS becomes **"Running"**.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

#### Verify

Step 4:- Access Nginx
: - To access the Nginx service you will need the IP address of the Pod.
: - Look for the IP address under the **"IP"** column.

```bash
kubectl get pod example-pod -o wide
```

- relpace `example-pod` with your pod name.

Step 5:- Verify Nginx
: - Open a web browser or use tools like curl or wget to access the Nginx service.
: - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the default Nginx welcome page.

```bash
curl <pod_ip>:80
```

## Adittional Comands

View Pod Details:
: To get more **details of the running pod** use.,

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

This command provides comprehensive information about the pod, including events and conditions.

Accessing Pod Logs:
: To view the logs of a container within the pod, use kubectl logs.

```bash
kubectl logs mypod -c mycontainer
```

Replace mypod with your pod's name and mycontainer with your container's name.
